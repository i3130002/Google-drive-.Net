# Google-drive-.Net
This is a simple windows form application using .Net (C#) visual studio 2015 and google drive API 3.

## Install:
1. Sign-up and create Cloud Storage Service in here (https://console.developers.google.com/)
  * You may follow this https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/dotnet)
2. Place your client_id.json file into \Google drive sync\Google Drive sync (where client_id.json.example is).
3. Rebuild the project and you are ready to go.

## WHY THIS IS HERE
this was going to be an alternative to google drive application for windows, as it couldn't correctly sync my 11 GB of data. but as i though I'm the only one who has this problem forget all about it and place my very beginners code in here. so some one may continue or if people ask i would continue it. oh and I couldn't find V using visualstudio 2015 implementation of google drive so i guess it can help some people too.
